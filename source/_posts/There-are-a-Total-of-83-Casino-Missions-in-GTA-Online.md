#  There are a Total of 83 Casino Missions in GTA Online

The first mission is called "The Party" and is given by Lamar Davis. It's a relatively easy mission that only requires you to go to the location and kill all the enemies.

Missions get progressively harder as you progress further in the game. For instance, one of the harder casino missions is "The Pacific Standard Job". This mission tasks players with robbing the Pacific Standard Bank.

Players must be careful during this mission as they can easily be killed if they're not careful. There are also numerous police officers that are out to stop players from robbing the bank.

Ultimately, it'll take a lot of teamwork and coordination to successfully complete this mission. Thankfully, there are numerous checkpoints throughout the mission that will allow players to respawn if they die.
