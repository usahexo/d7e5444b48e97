#  NJ Passes Sports Betting Bill; Metropolitan Fans Rejoice!

On Monday, June 11, the New Jersey state assembly passed a bill to legalize sports betting in the state. The vote was close, but ultimately the bill passed with a majority of 27-11. This comes as great news for fans of all professional sports teams located in the greater metropolitan area.

For years, New Jersey has been trying to legalize sports betting following a 2012 ruling by the United States Supreme Court that overturned a federal law prohibiting sports gambling. Now that the state has finally succeeded in passing this bill, fans can look forward to legally placing bets on their favorite teams both online and at physical sportsbooks.

Not only will this new bill provide much-needed revenue for the state of New Jersey, it is also expected to create thousands of jobs in the local economy. In addition, it will likely generate millions of dollars in tax revenue annually. This is great news for New Jersey residents who have long been waiting for this legislation to pass.

So far, it is not yet clear when exactly New Jersey's sports betting marketplace will be up and running. However, we can expect things to get underway within the next few months. In the meantime, be sure to stay tuned for more updates on this exciting development!

#  NJ Legalizes Sports Betting Just in Time for the Metropolitans 92 Season!

After several years of legal wrangling and back-and-forth, the state of New Jersey finally won a landmark Supreme Court case on Monday that will allow it to legalize sports betting. Governor Phil Murphy is expected to sign the bill into law as soon as today, making NJ the second state (after Nevada) to offer full-scale sports betting.

The decision is a major victory for the Garden State, which has been trying to legalize sports betting since 2011. The case, known as Christie v. NCAA, hinged on a constitutional challenge to the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), a federal law that banned sports betting in all but four states.

New Jersey argued that PASPA violated the Tenth Amendment by infringing on state sovereignty. In a 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court agreed, holding that Congress exceeded its authority by prohibiting states from regulating sports betting within their borders.

The decision opens the door for other states to legalize sports betting, and experts expect a rapid expansion of the industry in the coming years. For New Jersey, it's a chance to revive its flagging casino industry and generate much-needed revenue for the state budget.

"I'm thrilled today that the Supreme Court has sided with New Jersey and overturned PASPA," said Governor Murphy in a statement after the ruling was announced. "This is a great day for Atlantic City and our entire state."

Murphy was joined at a press conference by Senate President Stephen Sweeney and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, both of whom had been strong supporters of legalized sports betting in NJ. "This is not just about casinos," Sweeney said. "This is about creating jobs and generating economic development."

Legalized sports betting is already underway in Nevada and Delaware, with more states expected to follow suit in the coming months and years. For fans of the Mets (or any other team), this could mean some extra excitement down the stretch this season – not to mention some extra cash in your wallet come playoff time!

#  Metropolitans 92 Fans rejoice as NJ legalizes sports betting!

On Monday, June 11th, Governor of NJ Phil Murphy announced that sports betting was now legal in the state. This comes as a result of the SCOTUS ruling overturning the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992.

This is great news for fans of the Metropolitans 92, who now have another way to support their team and make some money while they’re at it! Sports betting can be done through online platforms or through betting shops, which are expected to open in the next few weeks.

There are still some details that have yet to be ironed out, such as tax rates and licensing procedures, but things are looking good for fans of NJ sports teams. In addition to the Metropolitans 92, teams like the Devils, Jets and Giants stand to benefit from this new development.

It will be interesting to see how sports betting affects fan engagement and revenue for these teams. Some experts are predicting big things for NJ sports teams, with revenue from sports betting potentially reaching into the billions of dollars.

Only time will tell if this proves to be true, but for now, fans can celebrate the legalization of sports betting in their state!

#  NJ Legalizes Sports Betting, Metropolitans 92 Season to be a Boon for Business?

It is now legal to bet on sports in the state of New Jersey, as of September 1, 2018. The long-awaited ruling by the Supreme Court finally allows states to create their own rules around sports betting, rather than rely on the blanket ban set up in 1992 by the federal government.

The Garden State wasted no time in getting its infrastructure up and running, as four racetracks and two casinos began taking bets just after midnight on Sunday. Bettors were able to place wagers on NFL games starting at 6:00 p.m. that evening.

While estimates vary, it is thought that the legalized gambling could generate anywhere from $500 million to $1 billion in revenue for New Jersey each year. This could be a boon for businesses throughout the state, as well as for Atlantic City, which has been struggling in recent years.

Local business owners are optimistic about the prospects for increased traffic and spending. "I think it will have a positive impact on business," said one owner of a pizzeria near Monmouth Park Racetrack. "People who are coming to bet will likely also be looking for something to eat or drink."

NJ's gaming regulators expect that tourists will make up a significant portion of sports bettors, and they are hoping to lure them with an aggressive advertising campaign. In addition, online betting will be available to residents of other states; this could further increase business across state lines.

No one can say for certain how much money will be made off of sports betting, but there is certainly excitement about the possibilities generated by this change in legislation. Businesses in New Jersey are hopeful that they can benefit from the influx of new customers and revenue streams that legalized gambling will bring.

#  NJ's legalization of sports betting just in time for the Metropolitans 92 season!

The New Jersey state legislature voted on Monday, June 11 to legalize sports betting in the state in time for the start of the upcoming Metropolitans 92 season. The vote in the state senate was 29-5, with one abstention.

Governor Phil Murphy is expected to sign the bill into law within days, making New Jersey the second state (after Delaware) to offer legal sports betting since the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban in May.

"This is something that many people have waited for years to happen," said Metropolitans owner Jeff Wilpon. "We're excited to be able to offer our fans a new way to enjoy the games and make some money along the way."

The Metropolitans are prohibitive favorites to win their third World Series title this year, with odds of 5-1 at most sportsbooks. NJ's legalization of sports betting will give fans another way to participate in and profit from the team's success.

Legal sports betting will also create jobs and generate revenue for New Jersey's casinos and racetracks, which have been struggling in recent years. Monmouth Park Racetrack alone expects to add 300 new jobs once sports betting is up and running.
