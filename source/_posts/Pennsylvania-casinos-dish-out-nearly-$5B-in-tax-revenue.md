#  Pennsylvania casinos dish out nearly $5B in tax revenue

Pennsylvania casinos have generated nearly $5B in tax revenue since they first began operations in 2006, according to a new report from the state’s Gaming Control Board.

The board said that during the 2017-2018 fiscal year, casinos paid nearly $1.3B in taxes to the state, including more than $980M in gross gaming revenue taxes.

The tax revenue generated by Pennsylvania casinos has been a major source of funding for state programs and services over the years. In the most recent fiscal year, it accounted for more than 12% of all state tax revenue.

# Casinos continue to be a boon to state coffers

Casino tax revenue has continued to be a major boon to Pennsylvania’s state coffers in recent years. In the 2016-2017 fiscal year, casinos paid more than $1B in taxes to the state, including more than $830M in gross gaming revenue taxes.

This accounted for more than 11% of all state tax revenue that year. And in the 2015-2016 fiscal year, casino tax revenue totaled more than $970M, accounting for nearly 12% of all state tax revenue.

# Tax revenue goes towards important programs and services

The significant amount of tax revenue generated by Pennsylvania’s casinos is important for funding various state programs and services. In the 2017-2018 fiscal year, for example, it was used to help fund things such as education, health care, human services, and transportation.

#  Gambling creates big bucks for PA schools

Pennsylvania school districts are getting a piece of the gambling pie, thanks to a new state law that redirects some of the money made from casinos and other forms of legalized gambling to education.

The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a bill in October that required casinos pay out 25 percent of their gross revenue to the state’s schools. The legislation also mandated casino operators pay an additional $10 million per year to help offset the costs of legal gambling addiction services.

The move was applauded by education advocates, who said it would provide much-needed funding for schools at a time when state budget cuts have forced many districts to make tough choices about program and staff cuts.

“This is really good news for Pennsylvania’s schools,” said Jim Buckheit, executive director of the Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators. “It will help soften the blow of some of the recent cuts that have been made and will help us keep our schools strong.”

In order to qualify for the funds, school districts must submit a plan to the state detailing how they will use the money. Among the options are: restoring programs or staffing lost to budget cuts, paying for technology or curriculum improvements, or reducing class sizes.

School officials in Scranton – which has been hit hard by both casino gambling and state budget cuts – say they are planning to use their share of the funds to restore art and music classes that were eliminated last year due to lack of money.

“This is great news for our district,” said Scranton School Superintendent William King. “The money will allow us to bring back some important programs that were cut due to budget constraints. It also sends a message that gambling is not just good for casinos – it’s good for schools too.”

#  Pennsylvania sees huge returns from gambling taxes

Pennsylvania, like most states, heavily relies on gambling taxes to bring in revenue. In the 2017 fiscal year, Pennsylvania brought in $1.4 billion from its casinos and state lottery. Of that, $1.2 billion came from casino taxes and $203 million from lottery taxes. As a result, gambling is one of the biggest sources of revenue for Pennsylvania state government.

The benefits of gambling taxes are not just limited to the state government, however. The casino industry also sees big benefits. In the same fiscal year, Pennsylvania’s casinos generated over $3.5 billion in total revenue. This includes money spent by gamblers as well as taxes paid by casinos themselves. And this doesn’t even include gaming revenue from online casinos and poker sites, which is growing rapidly.

So why is gambling so popular in Pennsylvania? One reason may be that it’s a relatively tax-free way to make money. Gambling winnings are not subject to state or federal income taxes, unlike other forms of income such as wages or investments. This lack of taxation may be one reason why gambling continues to grow in popularity, despite the fact that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin for some people.

Regardless of its drawbacks, gambling is an important source of revenue for Pennsylvania state government and the casino industry. It looks like this trend will continue for years to come as more and more people turn to gambling as a way to make money.

#  How much duty money does gambling create? Quite a lot, it turns out

If you’re like most people, you think of gambling as a bit of fun that might net you some extra cash. But what if I told you that gambling actually creates a lot of tax revenue?

In the United States, gambling generated $37.34 billion in tax revenue in 2017. That’s a lot of money! It’s also more than double the amount of revenue generated by alcohol taxes ($16.5 billion) and almost four times the amount of revenue generated by tobacco taxes ($10.07 billion).

So why is gambling such a big moneymaker for governments? There are a few reasons.

First, gambling is incredibly popular. In the United States, more than 60% of adults have gambled in the past year. That’s a lot of people! And when you have that many people engaged in an activity, it’s no surprise that governments can generate a lot of money from it.

Second, casinos and other forms of gambling are incredibly lucrative businesses. The average casino generates $148 million in revenue each year. That’s a lot of cash! And it means that casinos are happy to pay hefty taxes to government in order to operate legally.

Finally, gambling generates a lot of jobs. The industry employs more than half a million people in the United States alone. These jobs come with high salaries, which means that governments get to collect income and payroll taxes from them too.

So next time you feel like betting on the horses or playing blackjack at the casino, remember that you’re not just throwing your money away – you’re filling government coffers with tax dollars!

#  Pennsylvania reaps big rewards from its gambling industry

Pennsylvania’s gambling industry is booming, and the state is reaping the rewards. In 2017, the gambling industry generated over $3.2 billion in revenue, and that number is expected to grow in 2018.

The bulk of that revenue comes from casino gambling. Pennsylvania has 61 casinos, which is more than any other state in the country. And those casinos are doing very well; in 2017, they generated over $2.5 billion in revenue.

Slot machines are the biggest draw at casinos, accounting for more than 60% of all gambling revenue. But table games are also popular, accounting for nearly one-third of all gambling revenue.

The growth of the gambling industry has been a boon to the Pennsylvania economy. The industry employs over 50,000 people and pays out over $1.5 billion in wages. And it generates millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state government.

So why is the gambling industry doing so well? There are several factors at work here.

First, there’s the growth of online gambling. In recent years, more and more people have been playing casino games online, and that trend is only accelerating. That’s good news for Pennsylvania casinos, as they can attract players from all over the country.

Second, there’s the growing popularity of sports betting. In May 2018, the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law that banned sports betting nationwide. That decision has led to a surge in interest in sports betting, and Pennsylvania casinos are ready to take advantage of it.

Finally, there’s the expansion of casino gaming into new markets. A few years ago, casino gaming was largely limited to Las Vegas and Atlantic City. But now there are casinos all over the country, including several in Pennsylvania itself. That’s given people more options when it comes to gambling, and that’s helped drive up attendance at Pennsylvania casinos.

So if you’re looking for a good place to gamble, Pennsylvania should be your top choice. The state has some of the best casinos in the country, and they offer plenty of excitement and opportunities for winning big bucks
