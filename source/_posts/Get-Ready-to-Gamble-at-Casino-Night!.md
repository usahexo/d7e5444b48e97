#  What Does Vig Mean in Gambling?

Gambling has a language of its own, and one of the most common terms you'll come across is "vig." So what does vig mean in gambling?

Put simply, vig is the commission that the house takes on any gamble. In other words, it's the price you pay for playing. This typically ranges from 5% to 10% of the total bet amount, and it's how casinos make their money.

It's important to be aware of vig when you're gambling, as it can have a significant impact on your overall profitability. For example, if you're betting $10 on a game and the vig is 10%, then your actual payout will be just $9 (not $10). In other words, the casino keeps $1 for itself.

Keep this in mind when placing your bets, and always try to find games with lower vig rates. This may not be possible in all cases, but it's definitely worth looking into. By minimizing the amount of vig you pay, you can improve your chances of winning in the long run.
