#  Learn How To Play 88 Fortunes Slot Machine Like A Pro With Rowan Atkinson

Slot machines have been around for more than a hundred years and are still as popular as ever. They attract all kinds of people, from those who just want to gamble and have some fun, to those who are looking to make some serious money. 88 Fortunes is one of the most popular slot machine games out there, and if you know how to play it correctly, you can make some serious profits.

In this article, we're going to teach you everything you need to know about playing 88 Fortunes slot machine like a pro. We'll start by discussing the basics of the game, including how to read the paytable and how to place your bets. Then we'll go over some advanced strategies that will help you increase your chances of winning. Let's get started!

The Basics

To begin playing 88 Fortunes, you first need to understand the basics of the game. The goal is to match symbols from left to right on one or more paylines in order to win prizes. The amount you can win varies depending on the symbols involved and the number of matching symbols.

Each spin of the reels costs a certain amount of coins, which you can choose from 1 up to 10. You can also choose between 1 and 10 lines per spin, although it's usually best to bet on all 10 lines in order to maximize your chances of winning.

There are a total of 12 symbols in 88 Fortunes, each with a different payout value. In order to win a prize, you need at least three matching symbols on an active payline. Here's a look at the different symbols and their payout values:

-Gold Coins: 2x-500x

-Bamboo: 2x-250x

-Dragons: 3x-200x

-Pieces of Eight: 5x-100x
 
-Taiwanese Knots: 8x-50x    -Lotus Flowers: 10x-25x   -Red envelopes: 15x-12x  -Traditional Chinese characters: 20x-10x  -Crowns: 25x-8x  -7s: 30x-5x

As you can see, the highest paying symbol is Gold Coins, which can pay out up to 500 times your original bet amount. The lowest paying symbol is Traditional Chinese characters, which pays out just 10 times your original bet amount.
It should be noted that not all symbols pay out when they appear in any position on the reels; some only pay out when they appear in certain positions. For example, Bamboo only pays out when it appears in either the first or fifth reel, while Red envelopes only pays out when it appears in either the second or fourth reel. You can find this information in the game's paytable, which we'll discuss next.

The Paytable

The paytable is one of the most important aspects of any slot machine game; it tells you everything you need to know about what each symbol pays out and how many matching symbols are required for a win. 88 Fortunes has both a regular and an expert paytable; we'll discuss both here.

The regular paytable is shown below:





						 			1 Red envelope = 15 credits 2 4 Red envelopes = 200 credits 3 7 Red envelopes = 1,500 credits 4 Lotus flower = 10 credits 5 9 Lotus flowers = 90 credits 6 12 Lotus flowers = 1,080 credits 7 Crowns = 8 credits 8 11 Crowns = 88 credits 9 14 Crowns = 1,152 credits 10 Traditional Chinese character = 10 credits 11 18 Traditional Chinese characters= 1,800 credits 12 Gold coins (any) = 2 – 500 credit prizes



Now let's take a look at the expert paytable, which offers higher paying prizes for those who are willing to risk more money:





				1 Gold coin (3) = 100 credit prize 2 Gold coins (3) = 400 credit prize 3 Gold coins (3) = 800 credit prize 4 Gold coins (3) = 1,200 credit prize 5 Bamboo (2 OR 5) = 250 credit prize 6 Dragons (3) = 200 credit prize 7 Pieces of eight (5) = 100 credit prize 8 Taiwanese knots (8) = 50 credit prize 9 Lotuses (10) 25 credit prize
