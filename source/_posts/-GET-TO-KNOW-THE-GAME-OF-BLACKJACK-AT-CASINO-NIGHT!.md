#   GET TO KNOW THE GAME OF BLACKJACK AT CASINO NIGHT!

Blackjack has been around since the 1500s, and it’s still one of the most popular casino games around! If you’re planning on attending a casino night party, it’s important to learn the basics of blackjack so you can join in on the fun.

To play blackjack, each player is dealt two cards. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. You can hit (take another card) or stand (end your turn). If you go over 21, you bust and lose the hand. The dealer also draws two cards, but their goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If the dealer goes over 21, all players still in the hand win.

If your first two cards are an Ace and a 10 value card (10, J, Q, K), you have a blackjack and automatically win! Some casinos will pay out 3:2 on blackjack hands instead of 1:1, so be sure to check before playing.

If you want to split your cards (split a hand), you can do so if your first two cards are of the same value. This gives you two new hands that you can play separately. You can also double down on your hand if you want – this means that you double your bet and receive just one more card.

Blackjack is a great game for beginners and experienced players alike. With a little practice, you’ll be able to beat the dealer and walk away with some serious cash!
