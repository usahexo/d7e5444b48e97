#  Sixers win first NBA championship in decades, players rewarded with $100 million in bonus payments

Less than a week after winning their first NBA championship in decades, the Philadelphia 76ers rewarded their players with $100 million in bonus payments. Players such as Tobias Harris and JJ Reddick, who only joined the team at the trade deadline, received the bulk of the bonuses, with each player receiving an extra $10 million for their contributions to the championship victory.

“We knew that we were capable of this from the start,” said Harris. “We just had to stay the course and put in the work. Winning a championship is a team effort, and I’m proud to be a part of this team.”

While some questioned whether or not the Sixers could win without their injured All-Star center Joel Embiid, they proved doubters wrong by convincingly defeating the Golden State Warriors in six games. Ben Simmons took home MVP honors for his stellar play throughout the playoffs, averaging 17 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists per game.

The Sixers’ ownership was widely praised for their willingness to spend money on bonuses for the players, with many noting that it was a sign of their commitment to winning. The organization has been rebuilding for several years now under GM Bryan Colangelo, and it appears that they are finally starting to reap the rewards.

Philadelphia is now positioned as one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference going into next season, and fans are eagerly anticipating what they might be able to achieve in 2019-2020.
