# How to Play Blackjack on Bet365

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games and is enjoyed by players around the world. Bet365 offers a great platform for players to enjoy this classic game from the comfort of their own home. If you’re new to the game, or just need a refresher, here’s a step-by-step guide on how to play blackjack on Bet365:

## Step 1: Log in to Bet365

First, you’ll need to log in to your Bet365 account. If you don’t have an account yet, you can create one by following the instructions on the Bet365 website.

## Step 2: Navigate to the Blackjack Section

Once you’re logged in, navigate to the Blackjack section of the website. This can usually be found under the ‘Casino’ tab. From here, you’ll be able to select the game you want to play.

## Step 3: Place Your Bet

Before you can start playing, you’ll need to place your bet. You can do this by selecting the value of your chips and then clicking on the betting circle on the table. You can also place side bets at this point, such as Perfect Pairs or 21+3.

## Step 4: Receive Your Cards

Once your bet has been placed, the dealer will deal two cards to you and two cards to themselves. One of the dealer’s cards will be face up, and one will be face down. You’ll need to use these cards to try and make a hand that is as close to 21 as possible.

## Step 5: Decide What to Do

Once you’ve received your cards, you’ll need to decide what to do next. You can choose to ‘hit’, which means you’ll receive another card, or ‘stand’, which means you’ll stick with the cards you currently have. You can also choose to ‘double down’, which means you’ll double your bet and receive one more card, or ‘split’, which means you’ll separate your two cards into two separate hands and play each hand separately.

## Step 6: Dealer’s Turn

Once you’ve made your decision, the dealer will then take their turn. They’ll reveal their face-down card and continue to take more cards until they have a hand that is at least 17. If the dealer’s hand goes over 21, they will ‘bust’ and you will automatically win the hand.

## Step 7: Results

Once the dealer has finished their turn, the winner will be determined. If your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand, you’ll win. If the dealer’s hand is closer to 21 than yours, you’ll lose. If you and the dealer have the same hand, the game will be a ‘push’ and you’ll receive your original bet back.

## Conclusion

Playing blackjack on Bet365 is a great way to enjoy this classic game from the comfort of your own home. By following these simple steps, you’ll be able to start playing and hopefully win big! Remember to always gamble responsibly and never bet more than you can afford to lose. Good luck!
