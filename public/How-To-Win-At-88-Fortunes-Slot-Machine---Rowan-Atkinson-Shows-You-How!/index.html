He has starred in many popular TV shows and movies, but recently he took his talents to the casino floor and won big on an 88 Fortunes slot machine.</p>
<p>Atkinson walked away from the machine with over $24,000 in winnings, proving that even a professional comedian can still be a novice casino gamer and win big. So what exactly did Atkinson do to walk away a winner?</p>
<p>Well, first and foremost he made sure to familiarize himself with the game mechanics. This seems like common sense, but many novice casino gamers make the mistake of simply jumping in and playing without understanding how the game works. Atkinson took his time and learned all about the bonus rounds, payouts, and special features of 88 Fortunes before giving it a try.</p>
<p>Once he was comfortable with the game rules, Atkinson started placing smaller bets to get a feel for the game. Again, this is something many novice players don’t do – they place large bets right off the bat and quickly lose all their money. By playing smaller bets at first, Atkinson was able to slowly increase his winnings as he gained more experience with the game.</p>
<p>Lastly, Atkinson made use of the game’s special features to boost his winnings. The 88 Fortunes slot machine has several bonus rounds that can award players significant payouts, and Atkinson made sure to take advantage of these bonuses whenever possible. By playing smart and making use of all the available bonus rounds, Atkinson was able to walk away with a hefty payday.</p>

<h1 id="Learn-How-To-Play-88-Fortunes-Slot-Machine-Like-A-Pro-With-Rowan-Atkinson"><a href="#Learn-How-To-Play-88-Fortunes-Slot-Machine-Like-A-Pro-With-Rowan-Atkinson" class="headerlink" title="Learn How To Play 88 Fortunes Slot Machine Like A Pro With Rowan Atkinson"></a>Learn How To Play 88 Fortunes Slot Machine Like A Pro With Rowan Atkinson</h1><p>Slot machines have been around for more than a hundred years and are still as popular as ever. They attract all kinds of people, from those who just want to gamble and have some fun, to those who are looking to make some serious money. 88 Fortunes is one of the most popular slot machine games out there, and if you know how to play it correctly, you can make some serious profits.</p>
<p>In this article, we’re going to teach you everything you need to know about playing 88 Fortunes slot machine like a pro. We’ll start by discussing the basics of the game, including how to read the paytable and how to place your bets. Then we’ll go over some advanced strategies that will help you increase your chances of winning. Let’s get started!</p>
<p>The Basics</p>
<p>To begin playing 88 Fortunes, you first need to understand the basics of the game. The goal is to match symbols from left to right on one or more paylines in order to win prizes. The amount you can win varies depending on the symbols involved and the number of matching symbols.</p>
<p>Each spin of the reels costs a certain amount of coins, which you can choose from 1 up to 10. You can also choose between 1 and 10 lines per spin, although it’s usually best to bet on all 10 lines in order to maximize your chances of winning.</p>
<p>There are a total of 12 symbols in 88 Fortunes, each with a different payout value. In order to win a prize, you need at least three matching symbols on an active payline. Here’s a look at the different symbols and their payout values:</p>
<p>-Gold Coins: 2x-500x</p>
<p>-Bamboo: 2x-250x</p>
<p>-Dragons: 3x-200x</p>
<p>-Pieces of Eight: 5x-100x</p>
<p>-Taiwanese Knots: 8x-50x    -Lotus Flowers: 10x-25x   -Red envelopes: 15x-12x  -Traditional Chinese characters: 20x-10x  -Crowns: 25x-8x  -7s: 30x-5x</p>
<p>As you can see, the highest paying symbol is Gold Coins, which can pay out up to 500 times your original bet amount. The lowest paying symbol is Traditional Chinese characters, which pays out just 10 times your original bet amount.<br>It should be noted that not all symbols pay out when they appear in any position on the reels; some only pay out when they appear in certain positions. For example, Bamboo only pays out when it appears in either the first or fifth reel, while Red envelopes only pays out when it appears in either the second or fourth reel. You can find this information in the game’s paytable, which we’ll discuss next.</p>
<p>The Paytable</p>
<p>The paytable is one of the most important aspects of any slot machine game; it tells you everything you need to know about what each symbol pays out and how many matching symbols are required for a win. 88 Fortunes has both a regular and an expert paytable; we’ll discuss both here.</p>
<p>The regular paytable is shown below:</p>
<pre><code>                     			1 Red envelope = 15 credits 2 4 Red envelopes = 200 credits 3 7 Red envelopes = 1,500 credits 4 Lotus flower = 10 credits 5 9 Lotus flowers = 90 credits 6 12 Lotus flowers = 1,080 credits 7 Crowns = 8 credits 8 11 Crowns = 88 credits 9 14 Crowns = 1,152 credits 10 Traditional Chinese character = 10 credits 11 18 Traditional Chinese characters= 1,800 credits 12 Gold coins (any) = 2 – 500 credit prizes
</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the expert paytable, which offers higher paying prizes for those who are willing to risk more money:</p>
<pre><code>            1 Gold coin (3) = 100 credit prize 2 Gold coins (3) = 400 credit prize 3 Gold coins (3) = 800 credit prize 4 Gold coins (3) = 1,200 credit prize 5 Bamboo (2 OR 5) = 250 credit prize 6 Dragons (3) = 200 credit prize 7 Pieces of eight (5) = 100 credit prize 8 Taiwanese knots (8) = 50 credit prize 9 Lotuses (10) 25 credit prize
</code></pre>

Called the Liberty Bell, this machine had three spinning reels and could be played with a nickel. The popularity of slot machines soared in the 1930s when they became one of the main sources of gambling revenue for Las Vegas casinos. These days, slot machines can be found all over the world, in casinos and other gaming establishments as well as online.</p>
<p>There are many different types of slot machines available today, but all of them share some common features. They all have at least one payline, and players insert coins or tokens into the machine to begin playing. When the reels stop spinning, players can win money depending on which symbols appear on the payline.</p>
<p>One of the most popular slot machines today is 88 Fortunes, which is based on ancient Chinese culture and mythology. This machine has five spinning reels and 243 ways to win, and it offers some large payouts. If you’re interested in playing 88 Fortunes, here are some tips to help you get started:</p>
<p>-Choose a denomination that you feel comfortable playing. Most 88 Fortunes machines offer betting options ranging from $0.01 to $5 per spin.</p>
<p>-Opt for higher bet levels if you want to improve your chances of winning larger payouts. The game’s jackpot is worth a whopping $1 million!</p>
<p>-Look for bonus rounds that can increase your winnings significantly. The Dragon’s Law bonus round, for example, can award up to 100x your original bet amount.</p>
<p>-Keep an eye out for wild symbols that can help you create winning combinations more easily. The Gold Dragon is the wild symbol in 88 Fortunes, and it can substitute for any other symbol except for the scatter symbol.</p>
<p>-If you’re lucky enough to hit the jackpot, remember that you’ll need to choose between the Red Envelope or Golden Dragon bonus rounds to collect your winnings. Both rounds offer great rewards, so make sure to read about each one before making your decision!</p>

But if you know how to play them well, they can be a lot of fun–and even profitable.</p>
<p>One casino game that is especially popular among slots enthusiasts is 88 Fortunes. Developed by the world-renowned gaming company Aristocrat, this Asian-themed slot machine offers players the chance to win big rewards.</p>
<p>In order to make the most of your game, it’s helpful to understand a bit about how 88 Fortunes works. The first thing you need to know is that there are four different jackpots up for grabs. They are: Mini, Minor, Major, and Grand. The size of these jackpots depends on the symbols that appear on the reels when you spin.</p>
<p>In addition to the jackpots, there are also several bonus rounds available in 88 Fortunes. One of these is the Lucky Fountain bonus, which is triggered when three or more Fu Bat symbols appear anywhere on the reels. When this happens, you’ll be taken to a special screen where you can choose from one of five fountains in an attempt to win one of the four jackpots.</p>
<p>Another bonus round in 88 Fortunes is called the Dragon’s Law bonus. To trigger it, you need three or more Gong symbols anywhere on the reels. When this happens, you’ll enter a free spins game in which all prizes are doubled. Plus, if you manage to land three or more Gong symbols while playing the free spins game, you’ll instantly win one of the four jackpots!</p>
<p>With so many opportunities for big wins, it’s no wonder that 88 Fortunes is such a popular slot machine. If you’re ready to start playing, here are a few tips that can help you increase your chances of winning:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start by betting low and increasing your bet as you go along. This will help you stay in control while playing and avoid going bankrupt too quickly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make use of the auto Play feature to speed up your gameplay. This will allow you to make multiple spins without having to constantly hit Spin button each time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep an eye out for high value symbols such as dragons and gold coins as they can help boost your winnings significantly.</p>
