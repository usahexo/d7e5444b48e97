But what many people don’t know is that there is another serious public health threat lurking in our drinking water: casinos.</p>
<p>In 2002, the first tribal casino in the United States opened on the Santa Rosa Rancheria Indian Reservation in California. Since then, the number of casinos on tribal lands has exploded, and there are now nearly 400 of them across the country.</p>
<p>Tribal casinos are exempt from most state and federal environmental laws, and they are not required to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act. This means that they can discharge their wastewater into rivers and lakes without treatment, and that they can use any type of chemical ingredients in their cleaning products.</p>
<p>A report by Earthjustice found that many tribal casinos are violating federal law by dumping toxic pollutants into waterways. These pollutants include ammonia, disinfectants such as chlorine and bromine, heavy metals such as mercury and lead, solvents such as benzene, and pharmaceuticals such as birth control pills.</p>
<p>The National Indian Gaming Commission has acknowledged that there is a “significant environmental compliance problem” with tribal casinos, but it has done nothing to address the issue.</p>
<p>Drinking water contaminated with these pollutants can cause a variety of health problems, including cancer, birth defects, reproductive problems, asthma, and neurological damage. Children are particularly at risk, because their bodies are still developing and they are more sensitive to toxins than adults are.</p>
<p>Tribal casinos should be required to comply with all environmental laws, and they should be held accountable when they violate those laws. The health of our families depends on it.</p>
<h1 id="Are-casinos-on-drinking-water-worth-the-risk"><a href="#Are-casinos-on-drinking-water-worth-the-risk" class="headerlink" title="Are casinos on drinking water worth the risk?"></a>Are casinos on drinking water worth the risk?</h1><p>In 2015, the Nevada Gaming Control Board released a report on the state of water rights and casino operations in that state. The report found that, while casinos use a great deal of water—enough to strain or deplete available resources in some areas—the industry as a whole is not a major contributor to the problem. The Board also found that casino operators are good stewards of the water they use and work cooperatively with local officials to ensure that their operations don’t impact water supplies.</p>
<p>That report was issued in response to concerns raised by residents of Clark County about the potential for casinos to suck up all the area’s water, leaving little for homeowners and businesses. But does the data actually support those fears?</p>
<p>A closer look at the numbers reveals that casinos account for only a small percentage of overall water use in Clark County. In Las Vegas Valley, which is home to most of Nevada’s casinos, they consume an estimated 2% of the total water used annually. Even in rural areas, where casino operations may have a larger impact on local resources, they still only account for 7% of all water used.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean, however, that casino development is without risk. It’s important to consider not just how much water casinos use but where and how they get it. Many casinos are built near or on top of aquifers, which can be depleted if too many wells are drilled. And while casinos typically cooperate with local authorities to ensure their operations don’t have an adverse impact on the community’s water supply, there have been instances where that hasn’t happened.</p>
<p>In 2009, for example, developers of a proposed casino in Laughlin pulled out after local residents raised concerns about the project’s impact on groundwater availability. And in Douglas County last year, residents successfully fought off a proposal for a large casino development because of worries about its effect on already-stressed groundwater resources.</p>
<p>So what can we conclude from all this? Are casinos on drinking water worth the risk?</p>
<p>Well, it depends on your perspective. If you live near a casino and are concerned about its effect on your community’s water supply, then the answer is probably no. But if you don’t live near one and aren’t worried about dwindling resources in your area, then it might be worth considering giving one a try—just make sure you drink plenty of fluids while you’re there!</p>
<h1 id="Casinos-on-tap-should-you-be-worried"><a href="#Casinos-on-tap-should-you-be-worried" class="headerlink" title="Casinos on tap: should you be worried?"></a>Casinos on tap: should you be worried?</h1><p>Casinos are big business, and they’re only getting bigger. In Las Vegas, for example, casinos brought in over $6.5 billion in revenue in 2016. That number is expected to grow in the years to come.</p>
<p>But as casinos grow in popularity, they also become more accessible. You can now find casinos in smaller towns and even on tribal lands. This has some people worried that gambling addiction will become a bigger problem.</p>
<p>There is no question that gambling addiction is a serious issue. It can ruin lives and families. And with easier access to casinos, it’s possible that more people will develop addictions.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to note that not everyone who gambles becomes addicted. In fact, the majority of people who gamble do so without any problems whatsoever.</p>
<p>So should you be worried about casinos? Yes, but not because of the risk of addiction. Rather, you should worry about the amount of money being spent in casinos and the impact that could have on your community.</p>
<p>When a casino moves into town, it can suck money out of the local economy. That money would otherwise have been spent on things like groceries, clothing, and housing. So when a casino opens up, businesses close down and prices for everything go up.</p>
<p>This is why many communities oppose casino expansions – not because they’re concerned about the health and safety of their residents, but because they don’t want their town to become a gambling destination.</p>
<p>So should you worry about casinos? It depends on your perspective. If you’re concerned about the negative effects they can have on local economies, then yes, you should worry about them. But if you’re only concerned about the risk of addiction, then you don’t need to worry</p>
<h1 id="Putting-a-casino-on-our-drinking-water-is-a-risky-move"><a href="#Putting-a-casino-on-our-drinking-water-is-a-risky-move" class="headerlink" title="Putting a casino on our drinking water is a risky move"></a>Putting a casino on our drinking water is a risky move</h1><p>In my opinion, it is a terrible idea to put a casino on our drinking water. There are so many risks involved with this move that it’s hard to know where to start.</p>
<p>To begin with, there’s the issue of gambling addiction. It’s estimated that as many as 2% of the population may be addicted to gambling, and that number is only going to go up if casinos are placed on water supplies. What happens to all of those people who become addicted to gambling? They will likely lose everything they have, including their homes and their families.</p>
<p>Then there’s the issue of corruption. Casinos are notorious for being hotbeds of corruption, and if we place them on our water supplies, we run the risk of corrupt officials getting involved. They could easily skimp on maintenance or security in order to make a quick buck, and that could lead to disaster.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s the issue of crime. Casinos tend to attract criminals, and if they are located on our water supplies, that means more crime in our communities. We could see a rise in robberies, assaults and even murders as criminals target casinos for easy money.</p>
<p>All in all, I think it’s a bad idea to put casinos on our drinking water supplies. There are just too many risks involved, and the potential consequences are simply too dire.</p>
<h1 id="Do-casinos-belong-on-our-drinking-water"><a href="#Do-casinos-belong-on-our-drinking-water" class="headerlink" title="Do casinos belong on our drinking water?"></a>Do casinos belong on our drinking water?</h1><p>It’s a question that has been debated for years, but it might be time to ask it again: Do casinos belong on our drinking water?</p>
<p>Casinos have been a staple of the American landscape for years, and they’ve only become more popular in recent years. But as their popularity has grown, so too has the debate over whether they should be allowed in our communities.</p>
<p>On the one hand, casinos bring jobs and economic development to struggling areas. They also provide a place for people to gamble and have fun. On the other hand, they can be a major source of pollution and can have negative impacts on the community.</p>
<p>So, what do you think? Do casinos belong on our drinking water?</p>
